The datasets provided have been partially cleaned, I just want you all to have a look to see if these sets will be useful for our data before we do a full clean and join them with our main pollutant dataset.

I have traffic data for the Metrobus which travels through 4 stations: The linea/line column relates to the route they travel; the Metrobus has 7 Lines.

For now our stations are on Line 3 (General Hospital, Miguel Hidalgo), Line 4 (Merced, Benito Juarez, Miguel Hidalgo) and Line 7 (Miguel Hidalgo). If someone has more current information on the Metrobus please update where needed.
